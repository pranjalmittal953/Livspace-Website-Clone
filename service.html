                    <h5>Why should Livspace design my home?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Livspace has redefined interior design through an end-to-end home interiors service that’s
                        powered by cutting-edge technology. Our marketplace brings you the expertise of some of
                        India’s best designers, service partners, a vast catalog of furniture and decor, reliable
                        warranties and professional installation — online —  making furnishing your dream home
                        personal and easy.</p>
                    <h5>How is Livspace different from contractors/ individual designers/ studios?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Livspace is a marketplace that brings you an online home design experience through
                        cutting-edge technology. If you were to design your home interiors through a contractor/
                        individual designer/ studio, it would essentially mean extensive amounts of research,
                        choosing materials, finishes and colors, sourcing furniture, coordinating with painters,
                        carpenters, and hoards of labor. With Livspace, we give you everything you’ll ever need —
                        from top designers, expert installation partners, designer furniture, products, reliable
                        warranties and much more.</p>
                    <h5>Which are the cities Livspace currently operates in?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Livspace is currently operational in Bengaluru, Delhi, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, and Mumbai.</p>
                    <h5>What kind of spaces does Livspace design?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Livspace offers complete interiors for all residential homes, be it small or big,
                        apartments or individual homes or villas. To book us for your home interiors,
                        <a href="hire-a-designer.html">fill up the form here</a>.</p>
                    <h5>What is full home design?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">In design parlance, when we use the term “full home design”, we’re referring to
                        designing interiors for the entire home, i.e, kitchen, bedrooms, living, dining and
                        any other spaces in your home.</p>
                    <h5>Can I get just a part of my home designed?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">In most cases, yes, Livspace can work with you to design a part of your home, be it
                        just your modular kitchen or your living room. However, we suggest a consultation with
                        a designer to get a definite answer, based on your unique scope of work.</p>
                    <h5>I live outside India but, I own a property in India. Can Livspace help design my home?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Yes, of course! Your Livspace designer is trained to manage consultations via email/
                        chat/ video. With our proprietary online tools, you can track the progress of your
                        home design from literally anywhere around the world!</p>
                    <h5>Who will work on my Livspace home project?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Livspace is proud of its diverse and strong community of top design and service
                        partners, who will design, deliver and install your home. When you book us, you’ll
                        be matched with a design partner who will be your single point of contact through

                    <p class="ans">Yes, definitely. Our Design Centers are equipped with a wide range of designs, and
                        a vast library of materials and finishes to help you understand how Livspace can

                    <h5>How much time will it take to design my home?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Your Livspace designer will work at a pace suited best for you and your home.
                        Design time can depend on a lot of factors; choosing the products and finishes,
                        number of iterations, your availability, response time, etc. At Livspace, we
                        give you the freedom to share feedback and iterate designs several times.
                        Invariably, it can impact the overall duration of your project. Hence, to
                        get your final designs faster, while your designer would do their best, we
                        would also request for your continued support.</p>
                    <p class="ans">In our experience, finalizing all designs for a full home could roughly
                        take anywhere between 4 to 6 weeks. However, this is only indicative and
                        varies from project to project.</p>
                    <h5>How much time will it take to install my home interiors?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">At Livspace, we take pride in adhering to our promised timelines. Once your design is
                        finalised and moved to the execution stage, your designer will share a detailed
                        schedule of the installation timeline.</p>
                    <p class="ans">In our experience, installing your home interiors could roughly take anywhere
                        between 8 to 12 weeks. However, this is only indicative and varies from
                        project to project.</p>
                    <h5>If I have any queries/ concerns, who do I get in touch with?</h5>

                    <h3>Designing my dream home</h3>
                    <h5>What do I need to start my project?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">For the first design consultation, we suggest you carry your floor plan, any
                        inspiration,  and be prepared to discuss your requirements, your lifestyle and personality
                        in detail with your designer. We also suggest you go through our vast repository of
                        <a href="rooms.html">Livspace looks</a> and heart the designs you like, so that your designer
                        understands what your preferences are.
                    </p>
                    <h5>What should I expect from my design consultation?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">You’ll be meeting your Livspace designer in person at one of our Design Centers
                        or via video/ phone call if you live outside one of our operational cities. You’ll be
                        discussing your home needs, design goals, and ways to improve and utilize the space.
                        After the consultation, your designer will share a personalised design proposal with
                        estimated cost. To know more,
                        <a href="magazine/livspace101-contact-livspace/index.html">read our article here</a>.</p>
                    <h5>What is a design concept/ proposal and what will be included in it?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Your Livspace designer will put together reference designs, color palettes and
                        moodboards so that you can glimpse what your home could look like. Along with the design
                        concept, a tentative BoQ (bill of quantities) with furniture, products and home service
                        costings will be shared.</p>
                    <p class="ans">Please note: The cost reflected in the proposal is not the final bill value. It’s
                        only a tentative estimate and will vary based on the final design.</p>
                    <h5>What is a BoQ?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">A BOQ is a bill of quantities (BOQ), which is an itemised sheet of all products,
                        furniture, services and their costs.</p>
                    <h5>Where does Livspace source furniture and products from?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">We’ve curated an extensive catalogue where you can find anything and everything for
                        your home project — from sofas, beds, chairs, tables, lighting, appliances to kitchens,
                        wardrobes, storage units — in every shape, color and finish you can imagine! We offer our
                        in-house Livspace branded products as well as some of the best-in-category brands from India
                        and abroad such as Gulmohar Lane, Rug Republic, Hettich, Hafele, etc.</p>
                    <h5>How many design iterations can I request?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">There’s no limit to the number of iterations you can request. However, we recommend
                        keeping iterations to a minimum of three or four because each revision will affect projected
                        timelines.</p>
                    <p class="ans">Please note: Iterations are only allowed during the design phase. Once design is
                        finalised, design iterations will mean changes to your final order value and/ or cancelling
                        already placed orders, which may not be possible.</p>
                    <h5>Will I get to see samples and designs before I place the order?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Definitely! Your Livspace designer will give you an exclusive walkthrough of our
                        Design Center where you can touch and feel designs and explore our collection of thousands of
                        finishes and materials for your home interiors.</p>
                    <h5>A furniture item/ product from my BoQ is now out of stock. What do I do?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Don’t worry! Our vast catalogue is designed in a way that you’ll never run out of
                        beautiful furniture and products to choose from. Please talk to your designer to select an
                        alternate product.</p>

                    <h3>Managing my home project</h3>
                    <h5>Who will manage my project?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Your Livspace designer will be the single point of contact and will manage your
                        project, from start to finish.</p>
                    <h5>Will I need to manage the Livspace service partner?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">No. You wouldn’t need to. In fact, with Livspace your involvement during execution
                        is nil. Your designer will do all the managing for you.</p>
                    <h5>How do I receive updates on my home project?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Livspace ensures complete transparency when you design with us. When your site
                        execution begins, your designer will share a detailed timeline and schedule and will regularly
                        keep you updated on the progress via emails, calls, site meetings and through your Livspace
                        account.</p>
                    <h5>Do I have to regularly visit the site?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Not necessarily! Your Livspace designer will visit your site at regular intervals to
                        monitor work. Your designer will also schedule site visits with you to discuss any concerns.</p>
                    <h5>Who will be supervising the site work everyday?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">On a day-to-day basis, our service partner or their workers will be present on-site
                        to handle and supervise the execution work of your home project.</p>
                    <h5>Can I stay in the house if my home is getting renovated?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">We highly recommend speaking to your designer about the feasibility of staying in
                        the home while it’s being renovated.</p>
                    <h5>My project is taking longer than expected! What do I do?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Extended timelines can be due to a lot of factors such as design iterations. We
                        suggest you speak to your Livspace designer to resolve your concerns.</p>
                    <h5>I have concerns about my ongoing project. Who do I get in touch with?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">You can raise a red flag regarding your designer, your service partner and/or on any
                        other project-related complaints and escalate unresolved issues.</p>

                        products are handled by service partners, and then duly delivered and installed.</p>
                    <h5>Who are service partners?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Livspace service partners are trusted professionals, chosen from thousands of
                        service providers and contractors in your city. Our service partners undergo stringent
                        verification on 34 parameters, including quality, timelines, pricing and workmanship.</p>

                        Our regular audits weed out any non-performing service partners and blacklist them.</p>
                    <h5>At what point during the project, do I choose a Service Partner?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Once your final designs are ready, your designer will reach out to a select number
                        of service partners for quotations. Your designer, in consultation with you, will choose the
                        best suited service partner for your home interiors.</p>
                    <h5>Can I select the Service partner for my project?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Our algorithm matches you with a select number of Service Partners based on your
                        scope, budget, projected timelines and partner ratings. It is ideal and easier for your
                        designer to make a choice on your behalf as they have prior experience working with our
                        Service Partners. Since we invite quotes from several partners, the best price and quality
                        is ensured for your home interiors. Although if you’d like to be involved in the selection
                        process, please speak to your designer to know how.</p>
                    <h5>How many quotes will I receive from Service Partners?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Typically, a designer can find the best service partner for your home interiors
                        with only two to four quotations. As all our service partners are already vetted, Livspace
                        eliminates the need for dozens of quotations, saving you a lot of time. However, we would
                        be happy to share more quotes if you’re unsatisfied. But more quotations only means more
                        negotiations, which would impact your overall project timelines.</p>
                    <h5>The quotes shared by Service Partners are higher than I expected. Can I request for more quotes
                        that fit my budget?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Yes, you can. Your designer will reach out to more service partners and request for
                        quotes within your budget. Please speak to your Livspace designer to know how.</p>
                    <h5>Can I bring my own contractor to execute the design?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">No. But you needn’t worry! Our service partners undergo stringent audits before
                        they are invited onboard the Livspace marketplace. In each city, we work with over 200
                        partners.</p>
                    <h5>Will the chosen Service Partner offer everything that I require for my home project?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Your service partner is chosen based on your project scope. The prime consideration,
                        apart from cost, would be, if the service partner can execute all on-site services in your
                        design. However, niche services like home automation would require a field expert, and
                        therefore the requirement to add another service partner to your execution.</p>
                    <h5>How soon can I expect work to begin?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Your service partner will begin work as soon as we confirm the receipt of your order
                        confirmation payment.</p>
                    <h5>Will Livspace service partners affect promised timelines?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">We take pride in adhering to our promised timelines. Your designer will not only
                        assist you in choosing the right service partner based on your scope and timelines, but will
                        also ensure adherence to mutually agreed milestones and timelines. However, please note that
                        these timelines may be affected due to unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances, which will
                        be duly communicated to you by your designer.</p>
                    <h5>Who will be my go-to person during installation of the project?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">At any point during the project, from design to installation, your Livspace designer
                        will remain your go-to person. Please speak to your designer for any queries, concerns or
                        clarifications.</p>
                    <h5>Who will audit the quality of the project?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">A dedicated team at Livspace is tasked with regularly auditing the quality of your
                        site — to ensure smooth installation of your home project. Our audit team troubleshoots and
                        weeds out any non-performing service partners and blacklist them. Apart from this, your
                        designer will also be closely monitoring your project progression, quality of site work
                        and will keep you abreast.</p>
                    <h5>Are Livspace services chargeable?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Yes, all Livspace services are chargeable. Based on the design, scope and expertise
                        required, the cost will vary. However, all service costs will be included in your final bill of
                        quantities (BOQ), which is an itemised sheet of all products, furniture and services, before
                        you confirm your order.</p>
                    <h5>Are Livspace services inclusive of taxes?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Yes, all prices indicated in your BOQ are inclusive of taxes.</p>
                    <h5>Why is there an expiry date attached to the quote?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Livspace is a marketplace, and therefore we cannot exert any price control for
                        services, materials or labour cost rendered by third parties. All prices are subject to
                        change — except during the validity of the quote — because of market fluctuations.</p>
                    <h5>Will I receive a separate invoice from the Livspace service partner?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Yes. Livspace is a marketplace and therefore cannot issue an invoice on behalf of
                        services rendered by third parties. All invoices for the products and services catered to, by
                        registered service partners shall be issued by them, except for design and handling fees.</p>
                    <h5>Do the service partners offer a separate guarantee/ warranty?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Yes, some of our service partners do offer a separate guarantee. However, Livspace
                        is a marketplace and guarantees and warranties, if any, are directly provided by service
                        partners for products and services offered by them. Livspace only acts as a facilitator,
                        to ensure our partners honour their commitment/ guarantee/ warranty.</p>
                    <h5>How much damage does the insurance cover protect?*</h5>
                    <p class="ans">We ensure that all services provided by our service partners meet the highest
                        quality standards. However, in the event of unforeseen circumstances contributing to some
                        damage at your residence, Livspace pays for an insurance cover against damages of ₹10 lacs
                        or your project value, whichever is lower.</p>
                    <h5>Will I get a refund if I’m unhappy with the quality of work by the Service Partner?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Once your order is placed, refunds and cancellations will not be entertained.
                        However, if you’re unhappy with the quality of work of your service partner, we will offer
                        to replace your service partner. Please contact your Livspace designer or Community Manager
                        to know more.</p>
                    <h5>Are Livspace services available separately, on demand?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">No, Livspace services are not offered separately or on demand. Our service partners
                        are offered only when you book Livspace to design your home.</p>

                    <h3>Paying for my home interiors</h3>
                    <h5>How much would the entire design service for my home project cost?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">After the initial free design consultation, your designer will share a design
                        proposal with an estimated cost. Once you book us, this quotation will vary based on actual
                        design choices and material selection.</p>
                    <h5>Do you charge for site visits?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">While your Livspace designer will never charge you for site visits the number of
                        site visits is limited. Please speak to your designer to know more.</p>
                    <h5>What is covered under the final project cost?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">The final project cost of your Livspace home interiors includes everything —
                        furniture and products, design and management fee, charges for services, delivery and
                        installation, and taxes.</p>
                    <h5>What is design & management fee?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Livspace believes in complete transparency, which is why we disclose actual product
                        and service costs to you with no hidden costs for design and project management. Therefore,
                        we charge a flat 8% of your project value to compensate for your designer’s time spent on
                        design and project management.</p>
                    <h5>Why is the final quotation different from the initial quotation?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">The initial quotation from your Livspace designer is a ballpark figure to give you
                        an idea of how much it might cost to design the interiors of your home. As you start deciding
                        on designs, materials, furniture and products, this quotation may change (higher or lower than
                        initial estimations) depending on your choices.</p>
                    <h5>Does the pricing of the furniture and products change over time?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Yes, the pricing of our furniture and products may vary over time. Your final
                        quotation will have an expiry date for the price of the products and services offered.
                        Livspace is a marketplace, and therefore cannot exert price control on its partners,
                        except during the validity of the quote.</p>
                    <h5>Why don’t you charge according to the square footage of my home?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">The square footage of your home can never dictate the design and cost of your
                        interiors. For instance, we’ve had projects where a bare minimum 3BHK’s interiors would
                        cost lesser than intricate interiors for a 1BHK project. What this essentially means is,
                        our transparent pricing ensure you’re charged based on the designs, furniture and products
                        you choose and not on the mere square footage.</p>
                    <h5>Do I have to pay my design partner and service partner directly?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">No. To safeguard and track your transactions, kindly make all your payments to
                        Livspace directly. You’ll never have to make any extra/ separate payments to your designer
                        or service partner. Please visit our payments tab for more information.</p>
                    <h5>Do I have to pay premium on the insurance cover?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">No. Livspace pays for an insurance cover against damages of &#8377;10 lacs or your
                        project value, whichever is lower.</p>
                    <h5>When can I apply for a loan to get my interiors done?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Livspace has tied up with several banks to offer you attractive and flexible
                        EMI options. We recommend applying for a loan when your final designs are ready. However,
                        please speak to your Livspace designer for guidance on your unique needs.</p>

                <p><strong><sup class="text-primary">1</sup> Project and order:</strong> A project refers to home design undertaking for a single home.
                    Multiple orders can be placed for a single project (for eg., one order for modular products,
                    a separate one for services such as civil work). Payments are processed on an order level.</p>
                <p><strong><sup class="text-primary">2</sup> Booking Livspace:</strong> You can book your interior project with Livspace by paying a booking fee which
                    is charged at 10% of the estimated order value. The booking fee is adjusted against future orders.
                    If the scope of your project increases significantly, you may be required to pay 10% for the new
                    scope before design can begin.</p>
                <p><strong><sup class="text-primary">3</sup> Core Milestone:</strong> Milestones help us track the progress of your order. Core Milestone
                    marks the completion of an important activity at which balance 50% payment (for that order)
                    will be due. Livspace can proceed with completing the rest of the order only after full payment

                <h3>Cancellations</h3>

                <h5>Cancelling your project</h5>
                <p>In the unlikely event that you decide to cancel your project after paying the booking amount
                    (10% of project value), Livspace will offer a refund to the tune of half of your booking amount.
                    The refund is processed as Livspace store credits only.</p>
                <p>You can cancel your project at any time between booking us and placing your final order (between
                    10% and 50% payment).</p>
                <p>Please note: No refunds can be entertained if you cancel your project after 50% payment.
                    However, we would like to get a chance to redress your grievances, if any, in order to help you
                    change your mind. Tell us how we can serve you better by writing to

                    discussing designs with your team i.e. till the Sales Order is not created.</p>
                <p>Post final order: Because each item is made to order, Livspace cannot offer to cancel, replace or
                    modify items once the final order is placed i.e. a sales order is created. However, please be
                    assured that your design team will always explicitly discuss all items with you before
                    placing orders.</p>

                <h3>Designing & earning</h3>
                <section class="q-a">
                    <h5>How many project leads can I expect to receive?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">As many as you’d like. And no, we’re not kidding. Your community manager
                        will assign you fresh leads as your sales pipeline clears. For instance,
                        if you can juggle three projects at the design stage, and you already
                        have two at execution and only one at the pitch stage, your manager will
                        assign you fresh leads for you to start pitching to immediately. These
                        numbers are all indicative. Each design partner has a different capacity,
                        some can handle more, some less. So, you as an individual/ studio/ entrepreneur
                        need to gauge your capacity.</p>
                    <p class="ans">Note: This is how your sales pipeline looks:
                        Pitching > Design > Execution > Handover > Snags</p>
                    <h5>Does Livspace filter the leads sent to design partners?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Yes. Our technology and digital marketing tools are designed to validate each
                        lead that comes in. For instance, if a lead is outside of our scope or
                        serviceable pin codes, the leads are automatically disqualified. Our
                        community managers will then assign leads to their design partners based
                        on their serviceable location, scope and budget.</p>
                    <h5>How many projects can I work on simultaneously, as a design partner?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">As many as you can handle! You will have unlimited access to fresh project
                        leads to take up. On an average, we have seen our design partners working
                        on about 6 projects at a time at various stages in their sales pipeline.</p>
                    <h5>What is Canvas by Livspace?</h5>
                    <p class="ans">Canvas is our very own proprietary, cloud-based platform that will help you
                        design, organise and manage your projects, collaborate with your team,
                        schedule meetings and even track orders — so you can design and earn without
                        any hassles!</p>

                                        designing interiors for the entire home, i.e, kitchen, bedrooms, living, dining and
                                        any other spaces in your home.</p>
                                    <h5>Can I get just a part of my home designed?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">In most cases, yes, Livspace can work with you to design a part of your home, be it
                                        just your modular kitchen or your living room. However, we suggest a consultation with
                                        a designer to get a definite answer, based on your unique scope of work.</p>
                                    <h5>I live outside India but, I own a property in India. Can Livspace help design my home?</h5>

                                        chat/ video. With our proprietary online tools, you can track the progress of your

                                    <h5>How much time will it take to design my home?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Your Livspace designer will work at a pace suited best for you and your home.
                                        Design time can depend on a lot of factors; choosing the products and finishes,
                                        number of iterations, your availability, response time, etc. At Livspace, we
                                        give you the freedom to share feedback and iterate designs several times.
                                        Invariably, it can impact the overall duration of your project. Hence, to
                                        get your final designs faster, while your designer would do their best, we
                                        would also request for your continued support.</p>
                                    <p class="ans">In our experience, finalizing all designs for a full home could roughly
                                        take anywhere between 4 to 6 weeks. However, this is only indicative and
                                        varies from project to project.</p>
                                    <h5>How much time will it take to install my home interiors?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">At Livspace, we take pride in adhering to our promised timelines. Once your design is
                                        finalised and moved to the execution stage, your designer will share a detailed
                                        schedule of the installation timeline.</p>
                                    <p class="ans">In our experience, installing your home interiors could roughly take anywhere
                                        between 8 to 12 weeks. However, this is only indicative and varies from
                                        project to project.</p>

                                    <p class="ans">For the first design consultation, we suggest you carry your floor plan, any
                                        inspiration,  and be prepared to discuss your requirements, your lifestyle and personality
                                        in detail with your designer. We also suggest you go through our vast repository of

                                    <h5>What should I expect from my design consultation?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">You’ll be meeting your Livspace designer in person at one of our Design Centers
                                        or via video/ phone call if you live outside one of our operational cities. You’ll be
                                        discussing your home needs, design goals, and ways to improve and utilize the space.
                                        After the consultation, your designer will share a personalised design proposal with
                                        estimated cost. To know more,

                                    <h5>What is a design concept/ proposal and what will be included in it?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Your Livspace designer will put together reference designs, color palettes and
                                        moodboards so that you can glimpse what your home could look like. Along with the design
                                        concept, a tentative BoQ (bill of quantities) with furniture, products and home service
                                        costings will be shared.</p>
                                    <p class="ans">Please note: The cost reflected in the proposal is not the final bill value. It’s
                                        only a tentative estimate and will vary based on the final design.</p>
                                    <h5>What is a BoQ?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">A BOQ is a bill of quantities (BOQ), which is an itemised sheet of all products,
                                        furniture, services and their costs.</p>
                                    <h5>Where does Livspace source furniture and products from?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">We’ve curated an extensive catalogue where you can find anything and everything for
                                        your home project — from sofas, beds, chairs, tables, lighting, appliances to kitchens,
                                        wardrobes, storage units — in every shape, color and finish you can imagine! We offer our
                                        in-house Livspace branded products as well as some of the best-in-category brands from India
                                        and abroad such as Gulmohar Lane, Rug Republic, Hettich, Hafele, etc.</p>
                                    <h5>How many design iterations can I request?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">There’s no limit to the number of iterations you can request. However, we recommend
                                        keeping iterations to a minimum of three or four because each revision will affect projected
                                        timelines.</p>
                                    <p class="ans">Please note: Iterations are only allowed during the design phase. Once design is
                                        finalised, design iterations will mean changes to your final order value and/ or cancelling
                                        already placed orders, which may not be possible.</p>
                                    <h5>Will I get to see samples and designs before I place the order?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Definitely! Your Livspace designer will give you an exclusive walkthrough of our
                                        Design Center where you can touch and feel designs and explore our collection of thousands of

                                    <h4>Managing my home project</h4>
                                    <h5>Who will manage my project?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Your Livspace designer will be the single point of contact and will manage your
                                        project, from start to finish.</p>
                                    <h5>Will I need to manage the Livspace service partner?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">No. You wouldn’t need to. In fact, with Livspace your involvement during execution
                                        is nil. Your designer will do all the managing for you.</p>
                                    <h5>How do I receive updates on my home project?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Livspace ensures complete transparency when you design with us. When your site
                                        execution begins, your designer will share a detailed timeline and schedule and will regularly
                                        keep you updated on the progress via emails, calls, site meetings and through your Livspace
                                        account.</p>
                                    <h5>Do I have to regularly visit the site?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Not necessarily! Your Livspace designer will visit your site at regular intervals to
                                        monitor work. Your designer will also schedule site visits with you to discuss any concerns.</p>
                                    <h5>Who will be supervising the site work everyday?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">On a day-to-day basis, our service partner or their workers will be present on-site
                                        to handle and supervise the execution work of your home project.</p>
                                    <h5>Can I stay in the house if my home is getting renovated?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">We highly recommend speaking to your designer about the feasibility of staying in
                                        the home while it’s being renovated.</p>
                                    <h5>My project is taking longer than expected! What do I do?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Extended timelines can be due to a lot of factors such as design iterations. We
                                        suggest you speak to your Livspace designer to resolve your concerns.</p>
                                    <h5>I have concerns about my ongoing project. Who do I get in touch with?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">You can raise a red flag regarding your designer, your service partner and/or on any
                                        other project-related complaints and escalate unresolved issues.</p>

                                    <p class="ans">Your on-site execution will be handled by expert service partners, trusted and
                                        handpicked from over thousands of service providers and contractors in your city, to give you
                                        a superlative home design experience. All Livspace branded products are manufactured at our
                                        state-of-the-art factories, partner brands handle their own manufacturing, and customised
                                        products are handled by service partners, and then duly delivered and installed.</p>
                                    <h5>Who are service partners?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Livspace service partners are trusted professionals, chosen from thousands of
                                        service providers and contractors in your city. Our service partners undergo stringent
                                        verification on 34 parameters, including quality, timelines, pricing and workmanship.</p>
                                    <h5>What are the parameters on which Livspace vets service partners?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">We use over 34 parameters like pricing, craftsmanship, adherence to timelines,
                                        labor management, site preservation etc ensure your home interiors is in the best hands.
                                        Our regular audits weed out any non-performing service partners and blacklist them.</p>
                                    <h5>At what point during the project, do I choose a Service Partner?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Once your final designs are ready, your designer will reach out to a select number
                                        of service partners for quotations. Your designer, in consultation with you, will choose the
                                        best suited service partner for your home interiors.</p>
                                    <h5>Can I select the Service partner for my project?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Our algorithm matches you with a select number of Service Partners based on your
                                        scope, budget, projected timelines and partner ratings. It is ideal and easier for your
                                        designer to make a choice on your behalf as they have prior experience working with our
                                        Service Partners. Since we invite quotes from several partners, the best price and quality
                                        is ensured for your home interiors. Although if you’d like to be involved in the selection
                                        process, please speak to your designer to know how.</p>
                                    <h5>How many quotes will I receive from Service Partners?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Typically, a designer can find the best service partner for your home interiors
                                        with only two to four quotations. As all our service partners are already vetted, Livspace
                                        eliminates the need for dozens of quotations, saving you a lot of time. However, we would
                                        be happy to share more quotes if you’re unsatisfied. But more quotations only means more
                                        negotiations, which would impact your overall project timelines.</p>
                                    <h5>The quotes shared by Service Partners are higher than I expected. Can I request for more quotes
                                        that fit my budget?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Yes, you can. Your designer will reach out to more service partners and request for
                                        quotes within your budget. Please speak to your Livspace designer to know how.</p>
                                    <h5>Can I bring my own contractor to execute the design?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">No. But you needn’t worry! Our service partners undergo stringent audits before
                                        they are invited onboard the Livspace marketplace. In each city, we work with over 200
                                        partners.</p>
                                    <h5>Will the chosen Service Partner offer everything that I require for my home project?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Your service partner is chosen based on your project scope. The prime consideration,
                                        apart from cost, would be, if the service partner can execute all on-site services in your
                                        design. However, niche services like home automation would require a field expert, and
                                        therefore the requirement to add another service partner to your execution.</p>
                                    <h5>How soon can I expect work to begin?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Your service partner will begin work as soon as we confirm the receipt of your order
                                        confirmation payment.</p>
                                    <h5>Will Livspace service partners affect promised timelines?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">We take pride in adhering to our promised timelines. Your designer will not only
                                        assist you in choosing the right service partner based on your scope and timelines, but will
                                        also ensure adherence to mutually agreed milestones and timelines. However, please note that
                                        these timelines may be affected due to unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances, which will
                                        be duly communicated to you by your designer.</p>
                                    <h5>Who will be my go-to person during installation of the project?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">At any point during the project, from design to installation, your Livspace designer
                                        will remain your go-to person. Please speak to your designer for any queries, concerns or
                                        clarifications.</p>
                                    <h5>Who will audit the quality of the project?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">A dedicated team at Livspace is tasked with regularly auditing the quality of your
                                        site — to ensure smooth installation of your home project. Our audit team troubleshoots and
                                        weeds out any non-performing service partners and blacklist them. Apart from this, your
                                        designer will also be closely monitoring your project progression, quality of site work
                                        and will keep you abreast.</p>
                                    <h5>Are Livspace services chargeable?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Yes, all Livspace services are chargeable. Based on the design, scope and expertise
                                        required, the cost will vary. However, all service costs will be included in your final bill of
                                        quantities (BOQ), which is an itemised sheet of all products, furniture and services, before
                                        you confirm your order.</p>
                                    <h5>Are Livspace services inclusive of taxes?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Yes, all prices indicated in your BOQ are inclusive of taxes.</p>
                                    <h5>Why is there an expiry date attached to the quote?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Livspace is a marketplace, and therefore we cannot exert any price control for
                                        services, materials or labour cost rendered by third parties. All prices are subject to
                                        change — except during the validity of the quote — because of market fluctuations.</p>
                                    <h5>Will I receive a separate invoice from the Livspace service partner?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Yes. Livspace is a marketplace and therefore cannot issue an invoice on behalf of
                                        services rendered by third parties. All invoices for the products and services catered to, by
                                        registered service partners shall be issued by them, except for design and handling fees.</p>
                                    <h5>Do the service partners offer a separate guarantee/ warranty?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Yes, some of our service partners do offer a separate guarantee. However, Livspace
                                        is a marketplace and guarantees and warranties, if any, are directly provided by service
                                        partners for products and services offered by them. Livspace only acts as a facilitator,
                                        to ensure our partners honour their commitment/ guarantee/ warranty.</p>

                                    <p class="ans">We ensure that all services provided by our service partners meet the highest
                                        quality standards. However, in the event of unforeseen circumstances contributing to some
                                        damage at your residence, Livspace pays for an insurance cover against damages of ₹10 lacs
                                        or your project value, whichever is lower.</p>
                                    <h5>Will I get a refund if I’m unhappy with the quality of work by the Service Partner?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Once your order is placed, refunds and cancellations will not be entertained.
                                        However, if you’re unhappy with the quality of work of your service partner, we will offer
                                        to replace your service partner. Please contact your Livspace designer or Community Manager
                                        to know more.</p>
                                    <h5>Are Livspace services available separately, on demand?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">No, Livspace services are not offered separately or on demand. Our service partners
                                        are offered only when you book Livspace to design your home.</p>

                                    <h4>Paying for my home interiors</h4>
                                    <h5>How much would the entire design service for my home project cost?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">After the initial free design consultation, your designer will share a design
                                        proposal with an estimated cost. Once you book us, this quotation will vary based on actual
                                        design choices and material selection.</p>
                                    <h5>Do you charge for site visits?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">While your Livspace designer will never charge you for site visits the number of
                                        site visits is limited. Please speak to your designer to know more.</p>
                                    <h5>What is covered under the final project cost?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">The final project cost of your Livspace home interiors includes everything —
                                        furniture and products, design and management fee, charges for services, delivery and
                                        installation, and taxes.</p>
                                    <h5>What is design & management fee?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Livspace believes in complete transparency, which is why we disclose actual product
                                        and service costs to you with no hidden costs for design and project management. Therefore,
                                        we charge a flat 8% of your project value to compensate for your designer’s time spent on
                                        design and project management.</p>
                                    <h5>Why is the final quotation different from the initial quotation?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">The initial quotation from your Livspace designer is a ballpark figure to give you
                                        an idea of how much it might cost to design the interiors of your home. As you start deciding
                                        on designs, materials, furniture and products, this quotation may change (higher or lower than
                                        initial estimations) depending on your choices.</p>
                                    <h5>Does the pricing of the furniture and products change over time?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Yes, the pricing of our furniture and products may vary over time. Your final
                                        quotation will have an expiry date for the price of the products and services offered.
                                        Livspace is a marketplace, and therefore cannot exert price control on its partners,
                                        except during the validity of the quote.</p>
                                    <h5>Why don’t you charge according to the square footage of my home?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">The square footage of your home can never dictate the design and cost of your
                                        interiors. For instance, we’ve had projects where a bare minimum 3BHK’s interiors would
                                        cost lesser than intricate interiors for a 1BHK project. What this essentially means is,
                                        our transparent pricing ensure you’re charged based on the designs, furniture and products
                                        you choose and not on the mere square footage.</p>
                                    <h5>Do I have to pay my design partner and service partner directly?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">No. To safeguard and track your transactions, kindly make all your payments to
                                        Livspace directly. You’ll never have to make any extra/ separate payments to your designer
                                        or service partner. Please visit our payments tab for more information.</p>
                                    <h5>Do I have to pay premium on the insurance cover?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">No. Livspace pays for an insurance cover against damages of &#8377;10 lacs or your
                                        project value, whichever is lower.</p>
                                    <h5>When can I apply for a loan to get my interiors done?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Livspace has tied up with several banks to offer you attractive and flexible
                                        EMI options. We recommend applying for a loan when your final designs are ready. However,
                                        please speak to your Livspace designer for guidance on your unique needs.</p>

                                    Multiple orders can be placed for a single project (for eg., one order for modular products,
                                    a separate one for services such as civil work). Payments are processed on an order level.</p>

                                    is charged at 10% of the estimated order value. The booking fee is adjusted against future orders.
                                    If the scope of your project increases significantly, you may be required to pay 10% for the new
                                    scope before design can begin.</p>

                                    accordance with the Livspace cancellation policy.</p>
                                <h5>Cancelling your project</h5>
                                <p>In the unlikely event that you decide to cancel your project after paying the
                                    booking amount (10% of project value), Livspace will offer a refund to the tune of
                                    half of your booking amount. The refund is processed as Livspace store credits
                                    only.</p>
                                <p>You can cancel your project at any time between booking us and placing your final
                                    order (between 10% and 50% payment).</p>
                                <p>Please note: No refunds can be entertained if you cancel your project after 50%
                                    payment. However, we would like to get a chance to redress your grievances, if
                                    any, in order to help you change your mind. Tell us how we can serve you better
                                    by writing to <a href="mailto:support@livspace.com">support@livspace.com</a> or

                                <h5>Cancelling/ replacing product(s) in your order</h5>
                                <p>Design stage: Any product in the tentative BoQ can be replaced or removed while
                                    you’re still discussing designs with your team i.e. till the Sales Order is not
                                    created.</p>
                                <p>Post final order: Because each item is made to order, Livspace cannot offer to
                                    cancel, replace or modify items once the final order is placed i.e. a sales order
                                    is created. However, please be assured that your design team will always explicitly
                                    discuss all items with you before placing orders.</p>

                                <p>Sorry, this option is unavailable for cancellations. Your refund will only be
                                    processed as Livspace store credits.</p>
                                <h6>How can I use Livspace store credits?</h6>

                                    subject to availability. Items like appliances, soft decor like curtains, etc.
                                    cannot be purchased with Livspace store credits. For a complete list, please

                                <p>A major reduction (50% or more) in project value (vis-a-vis the value at project
                                    booking) is considered as a cancellation.</p>
                                <h6>Why is only half of my booking amount refunded?</h6>
                                <p>Livspace takes pride in its exemplary design service. As each client gets access to
                                    a design team who personally works on designs and concepts for their home — putting
                                    in a lot of time and hard work — we are unable to offer a full refund after
                                    booking.</p>

                                    <h3>Designing & earning</h3>
                                    <h5>How many project leads can I expect to receive?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">As many as you’d like. And no, we’re not kidding. Your community manager
                                        will assign you fresh leads as your sales pipeline clears. For instance,
                                        if you can juggle three projects at the design stage, and you already
                                        have two at execution and only one at the pitch stage, your manager will
                                        assign you fresh leads for you to start pitching to immediately. These
                                        numbers are all indicative. Each design partner has a different capacity,
                                        some can handle more, some less. So, you as an individual/ studio/ entrepreneur
                                        need to gauge your capacity.</p>
                                    <p class="ans">Note: This is how your sales pipeline looks:
                                        Pitching > Design > Execution > Handover > Snags</p>
                                    <h5>Does Livspace filter the leads sent to design partners?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Yes. Our technology and digital marketing tools are designed to validate each
                                        lead that comes in. For instance, if a lead is outside of our scope or
                                        serviceable pin codes, the leads are automatically disqualified. Our
                                        community managers will then assign leads to their design partners based
                                        on their serviceable location, scope and budget.</p>
                                    <h5>How many projects can I work on simultaneously, as a design partner?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">As many as you can handle! You will have unlimited access to fresh project
                                        leads to take up. On an average, we have seen our design partners working
                                        on about 6 projects at a time at various stages in their sales pipeline.</p>
                                    <h5>What is Canvas by Livspace?</h5>

                                    <h5>Can I meet my clients at any of the Livspace Design Centers?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Yes of course! Our <a href="design-centers.html">Design Centers</a> are

                                    <h5>Do I get design assistance from Livspace?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Yes, you will. For all modular products, design assistants will be assigned to
                                        help with visualization and validation of the modular design.</p>
                                    <p class="ans">If you’d like support for other aspects of your project like creating 3D views,
                                        using a draftsperson or enlisting a site supervisor, please get in touch with
                                        your community manager, since these services are chargeable and will be
                                        deducted from your commission.</p>
                                    <h5>What is the incentive/ commission structure?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Your incentives structure has a fixed component and a variable component.
                                        The variable component is directly linked to your ratings. If your project
                                        completes with minimal hiccups and maximum client satisfaction, you can be
                                        sure to earn more. However, your overall earnings are directly linked to
                                        the project order value. The higher the order value, the bigger your earnings.</p>
                                    <h5>How do payments and incentives work?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Commission payouts will be transferred via NEFT on or before the 10th of the
                                        subsequent month of when your client makes a payment to us.</p>
                                    <h5>Are my ratings and earnings linked?</h5>
                                    <p class="ans">Yes. Your ratings will be based on your performance and overall client
                                        satisfaction. If your client has a superior home design experience, it
                                        will reflect in your earnings.</p>
